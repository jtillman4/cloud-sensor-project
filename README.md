# cloud-sensor-project
Cloud Sensor code for the Observatory

This includes the CPP (main.cpp) code I used to pick apart the CSV input it is recieving called putty.log

This also includes the Graphing GUI I created (graphing_gui.py) that reads the same log file and graphs it in a clear format.

The putty.log file is just an example log file I added so that you can test the programs
